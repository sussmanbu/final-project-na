Dataset 1: US Police Shootings https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsen1330/us-police-shootings
          The dataset takes out some insights on what factors would affect US police shootings. There are 10 columns and 4896 rows which contain basic information about “name”, “date”, “armed”, “age”, “gender”, “race”, “city”, and so on. The variables like “name” and “states” might be deleted because it seems not to influence the reasons on US shooting cases. We would like to address questions like whether or not factors such as “gender” and “armed” would affect the rate of shooting cases. Also, we could discuss if racism is objectively existing in the US by creating a bar chart to show the amount of US shooting cases based on different races.There are some challenges we need to solve like how to deal with “unknown” in the dataset. There is some data with different names that have the same identity and we could change them into one name in order to do the analysis more clearly.

https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-arrest-data-year-to-date
The data is from January 1, 2023, to December 1, 2023. It has 226873 rows and 19 different variables.  Which contains the date, the description of the cases, the criminal’s sex, race, and age range. Besides that, it also contains the coordinate of each arrest, and other factors.The NYPD Arrest Data is collected as part of routine police operations, documenting each arrest made by the NYPD. This data is likely collected to monitor crime patterns, assess police performance, and inform public policy and safety measures.
According to the Data, there are several questions we could address or discuss:
The relationship between arrest and demographic factors like sex, race, and age. We also could analyze the trend of the criminal rate through the year. However, we still have some challenges that need to be overcome. The first one is how to combine the coordinates in the data with the arrest cases to illustrate a crime rate region in the map. Also, Arrest data may reflect systemic biases in policing practices, complicating analyses related to race, sex, or age, how we could reduce the bias is the key challenge.
