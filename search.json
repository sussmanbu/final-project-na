    "text": "Explantory Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nOn this graph we are showing the number of cases per race among all races. On this graph we can see that the lowest number of cases per race are represented by the Indian/Alaskan native people. The highest is for colred people having over 11k cases during this period.\n\n\nSelecting by Incident_Count\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart presents a comparison of incident counts across the top 10 crime categories. The most frequently reported category is “Assault & Related Offenses,” which leads the chart. “Petit Larceny” appears as the second most prevalent, followed closely by “Dangerous Drugs.” The categories at the lower end of the spectrum, “Dangerous Weapons” and “Grand Larceny,” have the fewest reported incidents among the top 10.\n\n\nSelecting by Incident_Count\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'OFNS_DESC'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar chart visualizes the proportions of the top 10 crime categories distributed by gender, distinguishing between female (F), male (M), and unspecified (U). It’s apparent that male-associated incidents dominate each crime category, with a markedly higher proportion compared to females and unspecified genders across the board. Notably, crimes associated with “Dangerous Drugs,” “Felony Assault,” and “Robbery” show a substantial majority of male involvement. This chart effectively conveys the gender distribution within these crime categories but does not provide the actual number of incidents or contextual background that might explain the observed gender differences.\n\n\nSelecting by Incident_Count\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'OFNS_DESC'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph displays a breakdown of crime incidents by gender across different categories, with green bars representing males, red bars for females, and blue bars for unknown gender. A striking feature of the chart is the predominance of green bars (male incidents), which are consistently the highest in every crime category, indicating a higher number of male-associated incidents in these categories. The most significant numbers of incidents for both males and females are recorded in “PETIT LARCENY” and “ASSAULT 3 & RELATED OFFENSES.” Incidents with an unknown gender, represented by blue bars, are the lowest across all categories, suggesting that gender data is more often available than not. The overall trend suggests that while crime affects all genders, males are associated with a higher number of incidents in the data represented.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis bar chart illustrates the racial composition of crime across ten categories, with the green segment indicating a dominant proportion of Black individuals in every category, followed by White Hispanics, represented by the pink segment. The smallest proportions are contributed by Asian/Pacific Islanders and American Indian/Alaskan Natives, shown in orange and red. This visualization provides a proportional breakdown by race, with each color-coded segment corresponding to the percentage of total incidents attributed to that racial group, reflecting the diversity and potential disparities within crime statistics.\n\nnum_data &lt;-ds |&gt;\n  select_if(is.numeric)\n\ncor_matrix &lt;- cor(num_data, use =\"pairwise.complete.obs\")\n\nggcorrplot(cor_matrix, method =\"circle\", type= \"lower\", \n       lab= TRUE,lab_size=4, tl.cex =10, tl.col= \"steelblue\", title=\"correlation Matrix of Numeric Variables\")"

    "text": "Data set 1: US Police Shootings https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsen1330/us-police-shootings\nThe data set takes out some insights on what factors would affect US police shootings. There are 10 columns and 4896 rows which contain basic information about “name”, “date”, “armed”, “age”, “gender”, “race”, “city”, and so on. The variables like “name” and “states” might be deleted because it seems not to influence the reasons on US shooting cases. We would like to address questions like whether or not factors such as “gender” and “armed” would affect the rate of shooting cases. Also, we could discuss if racism is objectively existing in the US by creating a bar chart to show the amount of US shooting cases based on different races.There are some challenges we need to solve like how to deal with “unknown” in the data set. There is some data with different names that have the same identity and we could change them into one name in order to do the analysis more clearly.\nData set 2: NYPD Arrest Data year 2023 https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-arrest-data-year-to-date\nThe data is from January 1, 2023, to December 1, 2023. It has 226873 rows and 19 different variables. Which contains the date, the description of the cases, the criminal’s sex, race, and age range. Besides that, it also contains the coordinate of each arrest, and other factors.The NYPD Arrest Data is collected as part of routine police operations, documenting each arrest made by the NYPD. This data is likely collected to monitor crime patterns, assess police performance, and inform public policy and safety measures.\nAccording to the Data, there are several questions we could address or discuss: The relationship between arrest and demographic factors like sex, race, and age. We also could analyze the trend of the criminal rate through the year. However, we still have some challenges that need to be overcome. The first one is how to combine the coordinates in the data with the arrest cases to illustrate a crime rate region in the map. Also, Arrest data may reflect systemic biases in policing practices, complicating analyses related to race, sex, or age, how we could reduce the bias is the key challenge.\nData set 3 : Heart Disease Mortality Data Among US Adults (35+) by State/Territory and County - Alberto https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/heart-disease-mortality-data-among-us-adults-35-by-state-territory-and-county\nThe data set presented provides an in-depth look at heart disease mortality among U.S. adults aged 35 and older, segmented by state, territory, and county levels. Each row corresponds to a unique data entry, likely representing a specific demographic group within a geographic region. The data et contains information on the year of data collection, geographic identifiers, the data source, and specific details about the nature of the data, such as whether it relates to heart disease prevalence or mortality rates. Metrics such as the value, unit, and type of data are included, offering numerical information that could reflect mortality rates per capita or total reported cases.\nAdditionally, the data set is structured by categories such as gender, race, and ethnicity, allowing for a multifaceted analysis of heart disease impact across different populations. This enables public health officials and researchers to visualize disparities in health outcomes and potentially identify high-risk areas or groups. Footnote symbols and explanations provide context for the data values, highlighting nuances or specific considerations, such as data suppression or estimation methods used. This rich data et is an essential tool for forming targeted health interventions, policy-making, and further studies focused on heart disease within the U.S. adult population."

It is crucial for the NYPD Arrest Data as it ensures that the data collection and reporting processes are open and understandable to the public.\nAdhering to the practice: Transparency would be enhanced by releasing detailed metadata with the dataset, explanations of each category, the decision-making processes behind data collection, and any changes or inconsistencies in data recording over time.\nLimitations and potential for misuse: A limitation in analyzing the NYPD Arrest Data could be the potential under-reporting or misclassification of incidents. Misuse of the data could occur for not understanding the systemic factors influencing policing, leading to skewed narratives about crime in different communities."

    "text": "Justice\nRelevance: In the case of NYPD arrest data, justice means ensuring that the data collection and reporting process is fair and does not disproportionately target or negatively impact specific communities, especially marginalized groups.\nAdhering to the practice: For fairness, NYPD should analyze arrest data for bias and disproportionality, particularly regarding race, ethnicity, and neighborhood. Corrective actions should be informed by these analyses to ensure equitable policing. Transparently sharing the outcomes with the public will further uphold justice and build community trust.\nLimitations and potential for misuse: The principle of justice faces the challenge of systemic biases in the NYPD Arrest Data, with issues like racial disparities. This complexity makes it difficult to directly address these biases through data analysis."

    "text": "Respect for Persons\nRelevance: This principle emphasizes the importance of respecting the dignity and rights of individuals who are arrested, ensuring that their personal data is handled with enough privacy.\nAdhering to the practice: For the NYPD Arrest Data, this means implementing strict data privacy measures to protect the identities of individuals, especially in cases that have not led to convictions. Additionally, it would require careful consideration of how data is shared in public and so to prevent stigmatization or harm to individuals’ futures.\nLimitations and potential for misuse: Protecting people’s privacy in the NYPD Arrest Data is hard because the dataset is big and has a lot of detailed information that could be used to identify someone. If the data isn’t kept anonymous, it might be used wrongly to single out people or places, causing problems like unfair treatment or more police attention."

Publish site to https://sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME/ using gh-pages? (Y/n)\n[[OP]] Wait for the process to finish.\nOnce it is done, you can go to the URL it asked you about to see your site.\n\nNote: This is the process you will use every time you want to update your published site. Make sure to always follow the steps below for rendering, previewing, and committing your changes before doing these publish steps. Anyone can publish in the future.\n\n\nCustomize your site\n\n[[OP]] Open the _quarto.yml file and update the title to include your team name.\n[[OP]] Go to the about.qmd and remove the TF’s and professor’s names.\nadd your own along with a short introduction and a link to your Github user page.\n[[OP]] Render the site.\n[[OP]] Check and make sure you didn’t get any errors.\n[[OP]] Commit your changes and push.\n[[OP]] Repeat the steps under Setting up your site.\n\nOnce one person is done with this, each teammate in the group can, in turn, repeat steps 3-7. Before doing so, make sure to pull the changes from teammates before starting to make new changes. (We’ll talk soon about ways to organize your work and resolve conflicts.)\n\n\nStart your first post\n\nTo start your first post first, run remotes::install_github(\"sussmanbu/quartopost\") in your Console.\n[[OP]] Run quartopost::quartopost() (or click Addins-&gt;Create Quarto Post, or use C-Shift-P, type “Create Quarto” and press enter to run the command).\n\nNow you can start working on your post. You’ll want to render your post to see what it will look like on the site.\n\nEvery time you want to make a new post, you can repeat step 2 above.\nWhen you want to publish your progress, follow steps 4-7 from Customize your site.\n\nFinally, make sure to read through everything on this site which has the directions and rubric for the final project."

    "section": "",
    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "This data comes from the NYPD website and is collected by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning of the New York City Police Department. This dataset provides a general overview of the nature of police enforcement activity in NYC by the NYPD to the public starting from 2006.\nSources: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/w/uip8-fykc/25te-f2tw?cur=r4FZeyikcAn\n\n\n\nThe collection of NYPD Arrest Data raises several concerns regarding its collection and subsequent analysis. Reporting biases might result from inconsistencies in how incidents are documented across different precincts or by individual officers, affecting data uniformity and reliability.

What are you trying to show? Make sure that you explain your analysis in detail but don’t go into top much mathematics or statistics. The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.\nEach figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.\n\nCreativity\n\nDo your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.\n\nThis page should be self-contained.\n\nNote: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use #| echo: FALSE."

This interactive component should in some way support your thesis from your big picture page. Good interactives often provide both high-level understanding of the data while allowing a user to investigate specific scenarios, observations, subgroups, etc.\n\nQuality and ease of use of the interactive components. Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components? Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions from the Big Picture? Plotly with default hover text will get no credit. Be creative!\n\n\n\nVideo Recording\nMake a video recording (probably using Zoom) demonstrating your interactive components. You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA. This video should be no longer than 4 minutes. Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website. This can be presented by any subset of the team members.\n\n\nRest of the Site\nFinally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site.\nThe main title of your page is informative. Each post has an author/description/informative title. All lab required posts are present. Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it. Your about page is up to date and clean. You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template."
