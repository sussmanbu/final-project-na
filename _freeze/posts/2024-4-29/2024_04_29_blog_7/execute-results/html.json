It all shows a trend that the crime rate will be higher in Summer and Spring, then it will gradually go lower in Autumn and Winter in 2023.This data suggests a correlation between warmer weather and increased crime rates in New York City, indicating that incidents tend to escalate during warmer periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024_04_29_blog_7_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Polish our graphs and charts\n\nTitles and Labels: We are going to craft clear, descriptive titles and axis labels that succinctly convey the meaning of the data, and use numbers to label each in sequence.\n\nLegends: We need to ensure legends are clear and correctly positioned. Modify legend titles to be informative and concise. Use a color scale that is intuitive and provides good contrast for the data represented.\n\nCaptions: we need to include captions that explain the visualization in a bit more detail, highlighting key findings or noting any caveats about the data.\n\nScales and Breaks: We decide to adjust scales and breaks on axes to make sure they are appropriate for the dataâ€™s range and distribution. \n\nColor Choices: We will ensure consistency across multiple visualizations, with the same color schemes, label formats, and styles used throughout.\n\n\nWe are planning to add a interactive graph that could brief will the crime variables in our dataset.\n\n\n\n",
