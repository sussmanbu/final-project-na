This data comes from [Visual crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services#)'s weather database.\n\n\nwe selected basic weather conditions for New York City for the year 2023 so that we could explore whether extremes in temperature, wind speed, and so on, affect crime rates, as well as crime trends under different weather conditions. This way it can be more efficient to optimize the efficiency of NYPD's police response. \n\n[Data Loading and Cleaning Script](scripts/load_and_clean_data.R)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: There was 1 warning in `mutate()`.\nâ„¹ In argument: `ARREST_DATE = mdy(ARREST_DATE)`.\nCaused by warning:\n!

Moreover, we will create a more localized heat map of New York neighborhoods which will provide clear visual insights into areas with higher crime rates, potentially informing policy decisions, law enforcement resource allocation, or community support initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
