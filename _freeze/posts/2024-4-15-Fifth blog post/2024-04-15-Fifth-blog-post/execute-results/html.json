This data comes from [Visual crossing](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather/weather-data-services#)'s weather database.\n\n\nwe selected basic weather conditions for New York City for the year 2023 so that we could explore whether extremes in temperature, wind speed, and so on, affect crime rates, as well as crime trends under different weather conditions. This way it can be more efficient to optimize the efficiency of NYPD's police response. \n\n[Data Loading and Cleaning Script](scripts/load_and_clean_data.R)\n\n\n\n### Weather Condition\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024-04-15-Fifth-blog-post_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates the frequency of Assault 3 incidents occurring\nunder various weather conditions. Clear weather and Rain with partially\nis associated with the highest number of incidents, followed closely by\novercast and partially cloudy conditions. Incidents are less frequent\nduring more adverse weather conditions, such as combinations of snow,\nrain, and overcast skies, suggesting possible correlations between\nweather and the occurrence of Assault 3 crimes.\n\n### Windspeed\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](2024-04-15-Fifth-blog-post_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis bar chart shows that incidents are most frequent in wind speeds\nranging from 10 to 20 km/h and significantly less frequent as wind\nspeeds increase beyond 20 km/h, suggesting fewer Assault 3 incidents\noccur in higher wind conditions.\n\n\n\nAnd our next step is to do the regression and logistic analysis to understanding the trends and patterns within the data. Moreover, we will create a more localized heat map of New York neighborhoods which will provide clear visual insights into areas with higher crime rates, potentially informing policy decisions, law enforcement resource allocation, or community support initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
