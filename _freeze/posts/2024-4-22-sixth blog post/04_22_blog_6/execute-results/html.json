The\nwinter months show a marked decrease in crime rates, possibly due to the\ncold weather discouraging outdoor activity. These trends indicate that\nenvironmental factors, such as temperature and seasonality, may play a\nsignificant role in the fluctuation of crime rates, necessitating\nseasonally adjusted strategies for law enforcement and community safety\nprograms.",
